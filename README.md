# Streaming ðŸ“º
#### Create your own media/streaming service at home using Sandarr, Radarr, Qbittorrent and Jellyfin. 

## Requirements
1. Decent Computer/Server

## Quickstart
### installation
you need to have an idea where you want your media server/streaming to run. you can run it on your personal computer (which i dont reccomended unless you have a extra HDD attached). Currently i use my PC, with a seperate drive with ubuntu server installed. You don't have to install a serperate os or anything as the applications themselves are dockerized for us. So that means you can also run them on windows(not that they dont have a windows versions though), running these applications with docker make setup much easier and less risky in case you break something (configs etc...).  

#### Docker 
Installing [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is a must. Docker allows us to run bare bone VMs that containerizes an application on our system, docker just works everywhere which is its usefull.

#### Docker-Compose file
Create a directory/folder where will create our [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file.

- ubuntu: `mkdir streaming`
- windows: `dir streaming`

create a file called docker-compose.yml, in the docker-compose file couple a things to note,
1. The shared volume for `/your/path/streaming/qbittorrent`  across the sonarr, raddarr, and qbittorrent must be the same path.
2. The shared volume `/your/path/streaming/tv` - Sonarr and `/your/path/streaming/movies` - Radarr must be the same path as you sepcified for jellyfin.

    restart: unless-stopped
```
#### Starting the Applications
Run in the same directoy as the docker compose file - `docker compose up`. docker will now download the images and run them.
Qbittorrent will give us a temporary login details just copy and save them real quick.
```sh
qbittorrent  | The WebUI administrator username is: admin
qbittorrent  | The WebUI administrator password was not set. A temporary password is provided for this session: UKH7QLHF8
```
